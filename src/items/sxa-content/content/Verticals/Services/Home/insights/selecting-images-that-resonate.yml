        <h2>1. Understand Your Audience</h2>
        <p>The first step in selecting images that resonate is understanding your target audience. Knowing their preferences, interests, and values will help you choose visuals that speak directly to them.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Strategies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audience Research:</strong> Conduct thorough research to understand your audience's demographics, psychographics, and behavior.</li>

            <li><strong>Analyze Competitors:</strong> Look at competitors' successful campaigns to see what types of visuals resonate with similar audiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Understanding your audience ensures that the images you choose will connect with them on a deeper level, increasing engagement and effectiveness.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Align with Your Brand Identity</h2>
