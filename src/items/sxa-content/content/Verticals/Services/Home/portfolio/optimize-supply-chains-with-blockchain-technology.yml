        <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Blockchain technology offers transformative solutions to these challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Transparency</strong>: Blockchain provides a decentralized ledger that records every transaction, offering real-time visibility into the movement of goods and reducing information asymmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Traceability</strong>: Each product’s journey is recorded on the blockchain, enabling companies to trace the origin and path of goods, ensuring authenticity and compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Prevention</strong>: Immutable blockchain records make it difficult to alter data, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring the integrity of transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Streamlined Operations</strong>: Automated smart contracts facilitate seamless execution of supply chain processes, reducing paperwork, minimizing delays, and cutting costs.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Supply chains encounter several key challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Transparency</strong>: Traditional supply chain processes are often opaque, making it difficult to track goods and verify authenticity.</li>
                <li><strong>Inefficiencies and Delays</strong>: Manual documentation and complex logistics result in delays and increased operational costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud and Counterfeiting</strong>: Without reliable tracking systems, supply chains are vulnerable to fraud, counterfeiting, and product diversion.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Silos</strong>: Fragmented systems lead to data silos, hindering collaboration and decision-making among supply chain partners.</li>
            </ul>
